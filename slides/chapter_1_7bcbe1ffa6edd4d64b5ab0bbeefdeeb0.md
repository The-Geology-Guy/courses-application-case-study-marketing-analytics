`@part1`
- **Clean Data Entry:** Data Validations {{1}}
- **Clean Data Aggregation:** Regular Expressions {{2}}
- **Visualize the Clean Data:** Google Charts {{3}}
- **Case Study:** Build a Marketing Analytics Dashboard {{4}}


`@script`
In this course, we will explore how to utilize Google Sheets for Marketing Analytics.

In this first chapter, we will cover how to make sure the data entry into the google sheet is clean and formatted correctly using the Google Sheets built-in tool Data Validations.

Next, we will look to aggregate data with similar IDs (such as campaign name or Marketing Channel) by using Regular Expressions to account for these slight variations of names that sometimes occur when more than one party is entering data.

Then, will we visualize the clean and aggregated data by constructing various charts that Google Sheets has available in its extensive toolbox.

Finally, we will take all that we have learned from this course and create a Marketing Dashboard that will aid in analysis of Bing and Google Ads Campaign Data.

## **Data Validations for Clean Data Entry**

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "cafa36954d"
```

`@part1`
- **Google Sheets for Clean Data Entry**{{1}}
     - Allows for multiple parties to enter data in real time{{2}}
     - Built-in feature 'Data Validations' for cleaner data entry{{3}}
- **Data Validations**{{4}}
     - Mitigate data entry mistakes{{5}}
     - Apply to a selection of cells{{6}}
     - Rejects erroneous data{{7}}


`@script`
Now, let us begin with Data Entry

Google Sheets is a great way to allow multiple parties to manually enter data into a single table. 

An example of this would be a Digital Marketing Team where team members may enter data from the various campaigns they are running into a single table.

The collaborative aspect of this example is great, but, manually entering data almost always leads to a few mistakes.

Luckily, we have Data Validations to help mitigate data entry issues.

These so-called Data Validations are simply rules that you apply to a selection of cells.

If the input to the cell does not meet the data validation criteria in place, then an error is shown in the cell [as seen in this image], or may even reject your entry outright, which we will discuss the later, later in this chapter.
